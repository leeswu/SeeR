      Figure 2. Hand-designed cutaway and exploded-view illustrations (left)
      design the cuts and explosions to emphasize the shape of the
      missinggeometry and spatial relationships among parts. Our system
      incorporates such principles to generate interactive cutaway and exploded-
      view illustrations (middle, right).

      A technical illustration combining medical and mechanical diagrams. On the
      left, anatomical and architectural cross-sections display structures such
      as bones, organs, and frameworks with labeled axes (e.g., "primary axis,"
      "transverse tube cut"). The center features a detailed cutaway of a jet
      engine or turbine, showing components like the "drive shaft," "primary
      turbines," and "propeller," with a focus on the internal mechanics. On the
      right, an exploded view of a mechanical system reveals gears, bearings,
      casings, and brackets, each labeled with identifiers (e.g., "Gear #63,"
      "Rear bearing #7"). The illustration integrates scientific visualization
      techniques from different domains.

      Figure 1. Harry Beckâ€™s map of the London Underground from 1933. Beck
      straightened the lines and more evenly spaced the stops to visually
      emphasize the sequence of stops along each line.

      A vintage London Underground map from 1933, designed by Harry Beck. The
      map features a schematic layout with various colored lines representing
      different tube routes. Station names are labeled in black and red text,
      with interchange stations indicated using larger circles. The famous
      "UNDERGROUND" roundel logo is displayed in the bottom right corner. The
      River Thames is depicted as a curved grey shape running through the map.
      The overall design is characterized by clean, geometric lines, a departure
      from earlier geographically accurate maps.
