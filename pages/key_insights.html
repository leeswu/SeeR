    <h1>Key Insights</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>Design principles connect the visual
            design of a visualization with the
            viewerâ€™s perception and cognition
            of the underlying information the
            visualization is meant to convey. </li>
        <li>Identifying and formulating good
            design principles often requires
            analyzing the best hand-designed
            visualizations, examining prior research
            on the perception and cognition of
            visualizations, and, when necessary,
            conducting user studies into how
            visual techniques affect perception and
            cognition.</li>
        <li>Given a set of design rules and
            quantitative evaluation criteria, we
            can use procedural techniques and/or
            energy optimization to build automated
            visualization-design systems</li>
