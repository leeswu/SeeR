        Design principles connect the visual design of a visualization with the
        viewer’s perception and cognition of the underlying information the
        visualization is meant to convey.

      <li>
        Identifying and formulating good design principles often requires
        analyzing the best hand-designed visualizations, examining prior
        research on the perception and cognition of visualizations, and, when
        necessary, conducting user studies into how visual techniques affect
        perception and cognition.
      </li>
      <li>
        Given a set of design rules and quantitative evaluation criteria, we can
        use procedural techniques and/or energy optimization to build automated
        visualization-design systems
