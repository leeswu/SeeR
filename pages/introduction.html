      Visual communication via diagrams, sketches, charts, photographs, video,
      and animation is fundamental to the process of exploring concepts and
      disseminating information. The most-effective visualizations capitalize on
      the human facility for processing visual information, thereby improving
      comprehension, memory, and inference. Such visualizations help analysts
      quickly find patterns lurking within large data sets and help audiences
      quickly understand complex ideas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the past two decades a number of books have collected examples of
      effective visual displays. One thing is evident from inspecting them: the
      best are carefully crafted by skilled human designers. Yet even with the
      aid of computers, hand-designing effective visualizations is
      time-consuming and requires considerable effort. Moreover, the rate at
      which people worldwide generate new data is growing exponentially year to
      year. Gantz et al.5 estimated we collectively produced 161 exabytes of new
      information in 2006, and the compound growth rate between 2007 and 2011
      would be 60% annually. We are thus expected to produce 1,800 exabytes of
      information in 2011, 10 times more than the amount we produced in 2006.
      Yet acquiring and storing this data is, by itself, of little value. We
      must understand it to produce real value and use it to make decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem is that human designers lack the time to hand-design effective
      visualizations for this wealth of data. Too often, data is either poorly
      visualized or not visualized at all. Either way, the results can be
      catastrophic; for example, Tufte24 explained how Morton Thiokol engineers
      failed to visually communicate the risks of launching the Challenger Space
      Shuttle to NASA management in 1986, leading to the vehicle’s disasterous
      failure. While Robison et al.20 argued the engineers must not be blamed
      for the Challenger accident, better communication of the risks might have
      prevented the disaster. </p>

      Skilled visual designers manipulate the
      perception, cognition, andcommunicative intent of visualizations by
      carefully applying principles of good design. These principles explain how
      visual techniques can be used to either emphasize important information or
      de-emphasize irrelevant details; for example, the most important
      information in a subway map is the sequence of stops along each line and
      the transfer stops that allow riders to change lines. Most subway
      passengers do not need to know the true geographic path of each line.
      Based on this insight, map designer Harry Beck redesigned the map of the
      London Underground in 1933 using two main principles: straightening the
      subway lines and evenly spacing the stops to visually emphasize the
      sequence of stops and transfer points (see <a href="https://leeswu.github.io/SeeR/pages/figure1.html">Figure 1</a>).
