      Visual communication via diagrams, sketches, charts, photographs, video,
      and animation is fundamental to the process of exploring concepts and
      disseminating information. The most-effective visualizations capitalize on
      the human facility for processing visual information, thereby improving
      comprehension, memory, and inference. Such visualizations help analysts
      quickly find patterns lurking within large data sets and help audiences
      quickly understand complex ideas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the past two decades a number of books have collected examples of
      effective visual displays. One thing is evident from inspecting them: the
      best are carefully crafted by skilled human designers. Yet even with the
      aid of computers, hand-designing effective visualizations is
      time-consuming and requires considerable effort. Moreover, the rate at
      which people worldwide generate new data is growing exponentially year to
      year. Gantz et al.5 estimated we collectively produced 161 exabytes of new
      information in 2006, and the compound growth rate between 2007 and 2011
      would be 60% annually. We are thus expected to produce 1,800 exabytes of
      information in 2011, 10 times more than the amount we produced in 2006.
      Yet acquiring and storing this data is, by itself, of little value. We
      must understand it to produce real value and use it to make decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem is that human designers lack the time to hand-design effective
      visualizations for this wealth of data. Too often, data is either poorly
      visualized or not visualized at all. Either way, the results can be
      catastrophic; for example, Tufte24 explained how Morton Thiokol engineers
      failed to visually communicate the risks of launching the Challenger Space
      Shuttle to NASA management in 1986, leading to the vehicle’s disasterous
      failure. While Robison et al.20 argued the engineers must not be blamed
      for the Challenger accident, better communication of the risks might have
      prevented the disaster.
    </p>

    <p>
      Skilled visual designers manipulate the perception, cognition,
      andcommunicative intent of visualizations by carefully applying principles
      of good design. These principles explain how visual techniques can be used
      to either emphasize important information or de-emphasize irrelevant
      details; for example, the most important information in a subway map is
      the sequence of stops along each line and the transfer stops that allow
      riders to change lines. Most subway passengers do not need to know the
      true geographic path of each line. Based on this insight, map designer
      Harry Beck redesigned the map of the London Underground in 1933 using two
      main principles: straightening the subway lines and evenly spacing the
      stops to visually emphasize the sequence of stops and transfer points (see
      <a id="fig1ref1" href="https://leeswu.github.io/SeeR/pages/figure1.html"
        >Figure 1</a
      >).
    </p>

    <p>
      Such design principles connect the visual design of a visualization with
      the viewer’s perception and cognition of the underlying information the
      vi- sualization is meant to convey. In the field of design, there is a
      long-standing debate regarding the interaction of aesthetic and functional
      properties of designed artifacts. We do not seek to engage in this debate
      here; rather, we focus on how particular design choices affect the
      perception and cognition of the visualization, not the aesthetic style of
      the visualization. Accordingly, we use the term “design principle” as a
      shorthand for guidelines that help improve viewers’ comprehension of
      visually encoded information.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many of the analysts and end users inundated with data and charged with
      creating visualizations are not trained designers. Thus, our work aims to
      identify domain-specific design principles, instantiating them within
      auomated visualization design systems that enable non-designers to create
      effective visual displays. While other researchers have considered
      specific ways to use cognitive design principles to generate
      visualizations (see the online appendix) we have been developing a
      general, three-stage approach for creating visualization design systems:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Stage 1. Identify design principles. We identify domain-specific design
        principles by analyzing the best hand-designed visualizations within a
        particular information domain. We connect this analysis with research on
        perception and cognition of visualizations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stage 2. Instantiate design principles. We encode the design principles
        into algorithms and interfaces for creating visualizations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stage 3. Evaluate design principles. We measure improvements in
        information processing, communication, and decision making that result
        from our visualizations. These evaluations also serve to validate the
        design principles.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      (See
      <a id="fig2ref1" href="https://leeswu.github.io/SeeR/pages/figure2.html"
        >Figure 2: Hand Designed Cutaway and Exploded View Illustrations</a
      >)
    </p>

    <p>
      We have used this three-stage approach to build automated visualization
      design systems in two domains: cartographic visualization and technical
      illustration. In cartographic visualizations, we have developed automated
      algorithms for creating route maps and tourist maps of cities. In
      technical illustration, we have developed automated techniques for
      generating assembly instructions for furniture and toys, as well as for
      creating interactive cutaway and exploded-view illustrations of complex
      objects. Here, we focus on articulating the techniques used to identify
      and evaluate the design principles for each domain. These techniques
      generalize to other domains, and applying our three-stage approach will
      lead to a better understanding of the strategies used to make inferences
      from visualizations.
