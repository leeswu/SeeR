      Figure 1. Harry Beck’s map of the London nderground from 1933. Beck
      straightened the lines and more evenly spaced the stops to visually
      emphasize the sequence of stops along each line.

      A vintage London Underground map from 1933, designed by Harry Beck. The
      map features a schematic layout with various colored lines representing
      different tube routes. Station names are labeled in black and red text,
      with interchange stations indicated using larger circles. The famous
      "UNDERGROUND" roundel logo is displayed in the bottom right corner. The
      River Thames is depicted as a curved grey shape running through the map.
      The overall design is characterized by clean, geometric lines, a departure
      from earlier geographically accurate maps.
