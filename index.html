    <h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>

    <h2>Introduction: Main Text</h2>
    
    <p>
      Visual communication via diagrams, sketches, charts, photographs, video,
      and animation is fundamental to the process of exploring concepts and
      disseminating information. The most-effective visualizations capitalize on
      the human facility for processing visual information, thereby improving
      comprehension, memory, and inference. Such visualizations help analysts
      quickly find patterns lurking within large data sets and help audiences
      quickly understand complex ideas.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Over the past two decades a number of books have collected examples of
      effective visual displays. One thing is evident from inspecting them: the
      best are carefully crafted by skilled human designers. Yet even with the
      aid of computers, hand-designing effective visualizations is
      time-consuming and requires considerable effort. Moreover, the rate at
      which people worldwide generate new data is growing exponentially year to
      year. Gantz et al.5 estimated we collectively produced 161 exabytes of new
      information in 2006, and the compound growth rate between 2007 and 2011
      would be 60% annually. We are thus expected to produce 1,800 exabytes of
      information in 2011, 10 times more than the amount we produced in 2006.
      Yet acquiring and storing this data is, by itself, of little value. We
      must understand it to produce real value and use it to make decisions.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The problem is that human designers lack the time to hand-design effective
      visualizations for this wealth of data. Too often, data is either poorly
      visualized or not visualized at all. Either way, the results can be
      catastrophic; for example, Tufte24 explained how Morton Thiokol engineers
      failed to visually communicate the risks of launching the Challenger Space
      Shuttle to NASA management in 1986, leading to the vehicle’s disasterous
      failure. While Robison et al.20 argued the engineers must not be blamed
      for the Challenger accident, better communication of the risks might have
      prevented the disaster.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Skilled visual designers manipulate the perception, cognition, and
      communicative intent of visualizations by carefully applying principles
      of good design. These principles explain how visual techniques can be used
      to either emphasize important information or de-emphasize irrelevant
      details; for example, the most important information in a subway map is
      the sequence of stops along each line and the transfer stops that allow
      riders to change lines. Most subway passengers do not need to know the
      true geographic path of each line. Based on this insight, map designer
      Harry Beck redesigned the map of the London Underground in 1933 using two
      main principles: straightening the subway lines and evenly spacing the
      stops to visually emphasize the sequence of stops and transfer points

The River Thames is depicted as a curved grey shape running through the map. The overall design is characterized by clean, geometric lines, a departure from earlier geographically accurate maps.</p>

    </p>
    
    <p>
      Such design principles connect the visual design of a visualization with
      the viewer’s perception and cognition of the underlying information the
      visualization is meant to convey. In the field of design, there is a
      long-standing debate regarding the interaction of aesthetic and functional
      properties of designed artifacts. We do not seek to engage in this debate
      here; rather, we focus on how particular design choices affect the
      perception and cognition of the visualization, not the aesthetic style of
      the visualization. Accordingly, we use the term “design principle” as a
      shorthand for guidelines that help improve viewers’ comprehension of
      visually encoded information.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Many of the analysts and end users inundated with data and charged with
      creating visualizations are not trained designers. Thus, our work aims to
      identify domain-specific design principles, instantiating them within
      automated visualization design systems that enable non-designers to create
      effective visual displays. While other researchers have considered
      specific ways to use cognitive design principles to generate
      visualizations (see the online appendix) we have been developing a
      general, three-stage approach for creating visualization design systems:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        Stage 1. Identify design principles. We identify domain-specific design
        principles by analyzing the best hand-designed visualizations within a
        particular information domain. We connect this analysis with research on
        perception and cognition of visualizations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stage 2. Instantiate design principles. We encode the design principles
        into algorithms and interfaces for creating visualizations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stage 3. Evaluate design principles. We measure improvements in
        information processing, communication, and decision making that result
        from our visualizations. These evaluations also serve to validate the
        design principles.

    <p>
      We have used this three-stage approach to build automated visualization
      design systems in two domains: cartographic visualization and technical
      illustration. In cartographic visualizations, we have developed automated
      algorithms for creating route maps and tourist maps of cities. In
      technical illustration, we have developed automated techniques for
      generating assembly instructions for furniture and toys, as well as for
      creating interactive cutaway and exploded-view illustrations of complex
      objects. Here, we focus on articulating the techniques used to identify
      and evaluate the design principles for each domain. These techniques
      generalize to other domains, and applying our three-stage approach will
      lead to a better understanding of the strategies used to make inferences
      from visualizations.

    <h2>Stage 1: Main Text</h2>
    <p>
      Stage 1. Identify Design Principles

      Design principles are prescriptive rules describing how visual techniques affect the perception and cognition of the information in a display.
      
      In some cases, they are explicitly outlined in books; for example, books on photography techniques explain the rules for composing pleasing photographs (such as cropping images of people just below the shoulders or near the waist, rather than at the neck or the knees). Researchers have directly applied them to build a variety of automated photo-manipulation algorithms (see the online appendix for examples).
    </p>
    <p>
      However, our experience is that design principles are rarely stated so explicitly. Thus, we have developed three strategies for extracting and formulating domain-specific design principles: Analyze the best hand-designed visualizations in the domain. Examine prior research on the perception and cognition of visualizations. When necessary, conduct new user studies that investigate how visual techniques affect perception and cognition.
      
      Hand-designed visualizations. We have found that a useful first step in identifying design principles is to analyze examples of the best visualizations in the domain. This analysis is designed to find similarities and recurring patterns in the kinds of information the visualizations highlight, as well as the techniques used to emphasize the information.
      
      Consider the problem of depicting the internal structure of complex mechanical, mathematical, anatomical, and architectural objects. Illustrators often use cutaways and exploded views to reveal such structure. They carefully choose the size and shape of cuts, as well as the placement of the parts relative to one another, to expose and highlight the internal structure and spatial relationships between parts.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Our process for identifying these principles is based
      on three main objectives:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Style independence. In order to
        identify a general set of principles we
        could apply to a variety of complex

        3D objects, we looked for visual tech-
        niques common across different artis-
        tic styles and types of objects;
      </li>
      <li>
        Generative rules. To ensure that we

        could apply the principles in a gen-
        erative manner to create cutaways or

        exploded views, we formed explicit,
        well-defined rules describing when

        and how each principle should be ap-
        plied. We designed the rules to be as

        general as possible while remaining
        consistent with the evidence from the
        example illustrations;
      </li>
      <li>
        Perceptual/cognitive rationale. We

        motivated each principle by hypoth-
        esizing a perceptual or cognitive ratio-
        nale explaining how the convention
        
        helps viewers better understand the
        structure of the 3D object depicted.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Through this analysis, we iden-
      tified a set of general, perceptually
      
      motivated design principles for creat-
      ing cutaways and exploded views. For
      
      instance, the size and shape of cuts
      
      in a cutaway illustration are often de-
      signed to not only reveal internal parts
      
      but to help viewers mentally recon-
      struct any occluding geometry that
      
      has been removed. Thus, illustrators
      cut radially symmetric objects with
      
      wedge-shape cutaways that empha-
      size the object’s cylindrical structure.
      
      Similarly, rectangular objects are cut
      with object-aligned cutting planes,
      
      or box cuts; skin-like covering surfaces are cut using window cuts</p>

        Illustrations of

        complex mathematical surfaces of-
        ten use exploded views in which each

        slice is positioned to reveal local geo-
        metric features (such as symmetries,

        self-intersections, and critical points).
        We have also examined “how things
        work” illustrations designed to show
        the movement and interaction of
        parts within a mechanical assembly.
        The hand-designed illustrations often
        use diagrammatic motion arrows and
        sequences of frames to help viewers

        understand the causal chains of mo-
        tion that transform a driving force

        into mechanical movement. After
        identifying the design principles, we
        implemented them algorithmically

        within interactive systems for gener-
        ating cutaways, exploded views, and

how-things-work illustrations
